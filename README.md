PCOS PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder affecting women of reproductive age, leading to irregular menstrual cycles, infertility, and metabolic complications. This project aims to analyze a PCOS dataset using machine learning techniques to identify key factors associated with the condition and build predictive models for early diagnosis.

In these project, the dataset contains medical and lifestyle-related attributes collected from women, including Demographic Details such as Age, BMI, and ethnicity, Menstrual and Hormonal Features such as Menstrual regularity, hirsutism, and acne severity, Metabolic Indicators such as Insulin resistance, stress levels, and PCOS family history, Diagnosis Label such as Indicates whether a person has PCOS (Yes/No). Among these the target variable is Diagnosis,which indicates whether the patient has been diagnosed with PCOS or not.

Using machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Randon Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM, the study aims to classify patients based on medical and lifestyle attributes. Data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation help derive insights that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention for PCOS.
